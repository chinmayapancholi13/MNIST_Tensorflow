# MNIST_Tensorflow
The objective of this project is to implement a 2 hidden layer multi layer perceptron using Tensorflow for predicting MNIST images.

The MNIST dataset is downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (four files) and extracted into a folder named 'data' just outside the folder containing the main.py file. That is, the code reads the input data files from the folder '../data'.
The `train` function in train_dense.py trains the neural network given the training examples and saves the weights in a folder named 'weights' in the same folder as main.py. 
The `test` function reads the saved weights and given the test examples it returns the predicted labels.
